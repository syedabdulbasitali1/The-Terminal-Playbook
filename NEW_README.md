## 🛠️ Command Line Basics

### Learn Basic Bash
- **Bash** is the default shell on most Linux systems and is essential to learn. You can start by typing `man bash` to read its manual. 
- For Windows users, consider using [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/) or WSL for a similar experience.

### Use a Command Line Text Editor 📝
- **Nano**: Beginner-friendly text editor. It's simple and shows all commands at the bottom.
- **Vim**: Advanced text editor with a steeper learning curve but great for speed and efficiency.
- Windows users can also install [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but having a command-line text editor like Vim or Nano can be useful when working in terminal environments.

## 🌟 Advanced Command Line Tips

### Git Version Control 💡
- **Git** is an indispensable tool for tracking changes in your projects.
  - `git status` - See changes and the current state of your repository.
  - `git add` - Stage your changes for a commit.
  - `git commit` - Save your staged changes with a message.
  - `git push` - Push local changes to a remote repository.
- Pro Tip: Use `git log --oneline --graph --decorate` for a clean, visual representation of your commit history.

### Pipes & Redirection 🔄
- Use pipes (`|`) to chain commands together. For example:  
  `cat file.txt | grep "keyword"` will search for "keyword" inside `file.txt`.  
- Redirect output to a file using `>` or `>>`. Example:  
  `command > output.txt` overwrites `output.txt` with the command's output.

### Searching with Grep 🧐
- `grep` is a powerful search tool. Some common options:
  - `grep -i` - Case-insensitive search.
  - `grep -v` - Invert the match (show lines that don't contain the pattern).
  - `grep -o` - Show only the matching part of the line.
  - Use `grep -r "text" .` to search recursively in all files within the current directory.

### Package Management 📦
- Linux: Use `apt-get` or `dnf` to install packages. Example:  
  `sudo apt-get install package_name`
- Windows: Use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) or [winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/). Example:  
  `choco install package_name`
