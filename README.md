### Windows Command Line Basics
Get Started with Command Prompt or PowerShell
- Command Prompt: The original Windows shell. Simple, fast, and useful for basic tasks.
- PowerShell: A more powerful shell with scripting capabilities, useful for automation and advanced system management.
- Batch File Automation: Create a batch file (`.bat`) to automate repetitive tasks. Write a series of commands in a text file, save it as `.bat`, and run it to execute all commands at once.
- Package Management: Windows: Use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) or [winget](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/package-manager/winget/). Example:  
  `choco install package_name`

### Use Command Line Text Editors üìù
While Windows offers powerful GUI text editors like Notepad++ and Visual Studio Code, having a lightweight command-line text editor can be useful when working in terminal environments:

- Nano: A beginner-friendly command-line text editor (available in WSL).
- Vim: An advanced editor known for speed and efficiency.

## Windows Commands Symbols and Syntax

This section provides an overview of common symbols, letters, and punctuation used in Windows command prompts. Understanding these can help you read and write commands more effectively.

### 1. Single Letters and Alphabet Combinations
- **C:** Often used to refer to the C: drive, the main hard drive on many Windows systems.
- **D, E, etc.:** Refer to other drives (D:, E:, etc.) connected to your computer.

### 2. Single Dash (`-`)
- Often used to indicate options or flags in commands. For example, `dir -a` (though in Windows, options often use `/` instead).

### 3. Double Dash (`--`)
- Typically used in other command-line interfaces (like Linux) to signify longer option names, but not commonly seen in Windows.

### 4. Square Brackets (`[]`)
- Indicate optional parameters in command syntax. For example, `dir [<path>]` means you can include a path, but it's not required.

### 5. Curly Braces (`{}`)
- Used in documentation to denote a set of choices. For example, `command {option1|option2}` means you can choose either `option1` or `option2`.

### 6. Parentheses (`()`)
- Used to group commands or parameters. For example, `if (condition) command` indicates that the command will run only if the condition is true.

### 7. Single Quotes (`''`)
- Used to enclose strings, especially when the string contains spaces. For example, `'My Documents'` keeps the phrase intact as one unit.

### 8. Double Quotes (`""`)
- Similar to single quotes but can allow for variable expansion within the string. For example, `"Path to file: %USERPROFILE%"`.

### 9. Exclamation Mark (`!`)
- Used in batch files to denote variables, particularly when using `enabledelayedexpansion`.

### 10. Ampersand (`&`)
- Used to combine multiple commands on a single line. For example, `command1 & command2` runs `command2` after `command1`.

### 11. Less Than (`<`) and Greater Than (`>`)
- **Less Than (`<`):** Used to redirect input to a command. For example, `command < input.txt` takes input from `input.txt`.
- **Greater Than (`>`):** Used to redirect output to a file. For example, `dir > output.txt` saves the directory listing to `output.txt`.
- **Double Greater Than (`>>`):** Appends output to a file instead of overwriting. For example, `echo Hello >> file.txt`.

### 12. Dot (`.`)
- Represents the current directory. For example, `.\file.txt` refers to `file.txt` in the current folder.
- **Double Dot (`..`):** Represents the parent directory. For example, `cd ..` moves up one directory level.

### 13. Colon (`:`)
- Used to denote drive letters (e.g., `C:`) or to specify a label or option in a command (e.g., `:label` in batch scripts).

### 14. Semicolon (`;`)
- Typically used to separate commands in some contexts, though less common in Windows command prompts compared to other systems.
